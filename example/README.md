# ap_flutter_kit_example

Demonstrates how to use the ap_flutter_kit plugin.

## Getting Started

This project uses an Interstitial Ad to demonstrate the ApFlutterKit usage. You can use any type of ad.

You can see in the example that you just need to call ApFlutterKit.ping() function when you receive an
Ad Impression Callback. That's all. Everything after it will be handled by ApFlutterKit itself.
